I'm fourteen years old.

Programming Languages: A little HTML and CSS. I've done a tiny bit of Swift in Xcode. Python is the main languge I'm using right now.

Main project right now: Jade

Jade is an virtual assistant for desktop, to help my friends and family, (also you if you want) I'm still working on it! I'm currently building a launcher.
