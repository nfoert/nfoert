I'm fourteen years old.

I've taught myself how to program, starting with block coding with Scratch and code.org, followed by some HTML, a tiny bit of swift, and now python.

## Jade Software
Jade Software is a project I've spent nearly a year and a half on. It consists of a Launcher that launches Jade Assistant which is as virtual assistant designed to help you in your day-to-day workflow.

I'm still working on Jade right now, but It's currently in a BETA Testing state. Want to give it a test for me? https://nofoert.wixsite.com/jade/download
