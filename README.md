I'm a completely self-taught programmer in Python. I started my programming journey via [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and Java Script on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming) I then moved on to [Code.org's App Lab](https://code.org/educate/applab) before introducing myself to [Python](https://www.python.org/) via a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/). I soon moved on to Python on an actual computer and that's how [Jade Software came](https://nfoert.pythonanywhere.com/jadesite) about. I had an idea for a project and I kept working on it, learning a bunch of skills at the same time. I've been working with Python for almost two years.

I learn by doing, and have been using Jade Software as a way to experiment with many different aspects of fully formed desktop applications.

I've also experimented with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), I learned CSS and HTML for the Jade Website and my blog, started learning C++, and I've done a bit of work with [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5). 
I've made a macro pad with a Raspberry Pi Pico W, hosted a minecraft server on a RPI 4, installed CFW on a Nintendo 3DS, made a [Minecraft modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/nfoerts-modpack-1.19.4), and created a cataloging system with a Raspberry Pi, Google Sheets and anything with a UPC.

(I also know enough markdown to make this README :smile:)

## Jade Software
Jade Software is a project I've spent two years on. It's a suite of productivity applications starting with the Jade Launcher, which is the main part which keeps itself updated, and allows you to update and download other apps like Jade Assistant or Jade Apps.
