<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm nfoert!</h1>
<p align="center">I'm a programmer in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C++. I care a lot about open source software, right to repair, linux, and federated social networks. I'm self taught, and I'm learning to make applications and software that has a real world use and reach. </p>
<hr>

I started my programming journey via [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and Java Script on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming). I then moved on to [Code.org's App Lab](https://code.org/educate/applab) before introducing myself to [Python](https://www.python.org/) via a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/). I soon moved on to Python on an actual computer and that's how [Jade Software](https://nfoert.pythonanywhere.com/jadesite) began. I had an idea for a project and I kept working on it, learning a bunch of skills at the same time. I've been working with Python for almost two years while experimenting with other stuff here and there.

I learn by doing, and have been using Jade Software as a way to experiment with many different aspects of fully formed desktop applications.

I've also experimented with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), I learned CSS and HTML for the Jade Website and my blog, started learning C++, and I've done a bit of work with [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5). 
I've made a macro pad with a Raspberry Pi Pico W, hosted a minecraft server on a RPI 4, installed CFW on a Nintendo 3DS, created a [portfolio site](https://nfoert.github.io/), made a [Minecraft modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/nfoerts-modpack), a [browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jade-new-tab/), and created a cataloging system with a Raspberry Pi, Google Sheets and anything with a UPC.

(I also know enough markdown to make this README :smile:)

## Circles
Circles is my open source, decentralized social media platform where users can move and interact within physical spaces (circles). Any user can create a Circle, and sub Circles within those. Circles is trying to move away from the way social media is now, a large wall of text and the real people behind those posts are hidden away. Circles' goal is to imbrace each person for who they are and allow them to connect with other people that share intrests and passions.

Circles is currently in a very early stage. [The repository is here](https://github.com/nfoert/circles)
The current location of the Circles website is [here](https://circles.pythonanywhere.com). Once I've got some more systems up and running, and I've got GitHub sponsors setup, users will be able to get added to the Circles whitelist by supporting me. Once I can afford servers and a domain, I'll end the closed alpha and original supporters will be given a badge.

I'd appreciate your intrest in my project.

## Jade Software
Jade Software is a project I've spent two years on. It's a suite of productivity applications starting with the Jade Launcher, which is the main part which keeps itself updated, and allows you to update and download other apps like Jade Assistant or Jade Apps.

Want to check out the Jade Launcher? [Download it here.](https://nfoert.pythonanywhere.com/jadesite)
